  The project was presenting an investment growth calculator for the user. The instructions were to allow for the user to make changes to the calculator after the initial calculation.
  
<p>What did you do particularly well?<p>
  I was pleased with my overall code and how it looks. This is also one of the few experiences I've had utilizing objects so far and I was pleased that I was able to remember how to code it.
  
<p>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?<p>
  I would really like to better understand how to fufill some of the requirements from the project. Like having the program recognize any button press and present the menu. 
  
<p>Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?<p>
  
<p>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?<p>
