<i>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</i><p>
  The project was presenting an investment growth calculator for the user. The instructions were to allow for the user to make changes to the calculator after the initial calculation.
  
<p><i>What did you do particularly well?</i><p>
  I was pleased with my overall code and how it looks. This is also one of the few experiences I've had using objects so far so I was pleased that I remembered how to code them. 
  
<p><i>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</i><p>
  I would really like to better understand how to fufill some of the requirements from the project. Like having the program recognize any button press and present the menu. I'm also sure that there are spaces where I could simplify the code more.  
  
<p><i>Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</i><p>
  I honestly find a lot of coding challenging right now. My biggest hurdle was the requirement to have the menu pop up with any button press. As stated I was unable to overcome that particular hurdle. However, I have found a great resource to be a school run slack group snhucoders. They've been great about pointing you in the right direction without just telling you how to do it. I also usually check stackoverflow as a lot of beginner questions have been answered on there in a really clear way.
  
<p><i>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?</i><p>
  I believe using objects will be the most important skill from this project. I've read that OOP princepals are really important for developers to understand. The more practice I have with objects the more likely those concepts are to stick.
  
<p><i>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</i><p>
